Born in 1987 in Dehradun, Varun Goel has a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from IIT Roorkee and currently works as a software engineer in Hyderabad. He spends his spare time reading books and watching movies.</p>

<p>About the Book
Varun started writing the book 'The Mystery of the Strange Island' at the age of 12 and finished it 3 years later. After years of wait, the book saw the light of day when Varun finally decided to get it published.</p>

<p>When a ferocious storm strikes the Strange Island, the enthusiastic bunch of school boys on a trip, transport themselves to a lonely faraway cottage for rescue, little to realize that they will be trapped in a wellcrafted plan by the wicked kidnappers. The heroic Arun braving the adversity manages to escape only to land himself in more trouble. Can he prove himself to be the real hero and help his friends escape the deathly 'Deadlys' or would everyone meet their end?</p>
